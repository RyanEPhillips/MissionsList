Feel free to customize and enhance this ToDo list to suit your needs!

I chose the design to make it colorful and game themed for the game of life.  I wanted to be able to add items to desired position on the list, but could not seem to get it.  I added the clear all feature for when the list is completed.  I was unsure how to get it to only display and work seperate from being displayed under each item.  I added the counter to display the total number of items on the list.  I also added autofocus for the cursor after each item add.
I learned a better understanding of bringing the web page together and how to reach items in other files.
